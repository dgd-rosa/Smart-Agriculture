# Smart-Agriculture
This is an IOT project where the Arduino communicates via LORA with the cellphone, sending data about the humidity and temperature of the air and the soil. With that information it may turn on the hose, if the humidity is low, or not. The materials used are below:

* 1 Arduino Leonardo
* 1 Model Lora / GPS Shield v95 868 MHz
* 1 DTH11 (Humidity and Temperature Sensor)
* 1 10KOhms Resistor
* 1 Moisture Sensor
* IRF520 MOS Driver Module
